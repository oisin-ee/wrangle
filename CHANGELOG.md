# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- Engine: `probe`, `admit`, `release`, `status`, `cancel`, `mark`, `queue`, `notify`, and the
  per-host `host` primitives. Balanced admission by headroom, TTL reservations under a
  per-host lock, queue tickets, remote hosts over `ssh -T` (`remote_command`, default
  `mise x -- wrangle`).
- Scaffold: Cargo crate, Pi package manifest, CI, cargo-dist release workflow.
